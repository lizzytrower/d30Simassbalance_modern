# d30Simassbalance_modern

Silicon isotope mass balance Monte Carlo model
Elizabeth Trower, June 2021
this code was designed with Matlab 2018b

This model is based on the bones of the code from Trower & Fischer 2019 (Sedimentary Geology);
it was redesigned to explore Si isotope mass balance in the modern silica cycle by Lizzy Trower and Shaily Rahman.

This is the publication version that pulls data from a static .xlsx file.

Plotting ternary diagrams of continental sink model simulations requires the Matlab "ternplot" package
